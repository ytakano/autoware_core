# Benchmarking

How the Rust port's performance is measured against the legacy C++ engine, and the current numbers.

The guiding principle is **capture-once, replay-everywhere**: capture representative inputs once,
then replay them deterministically through both engines so a comparison is apples-to-apples and free
of live-system jitter. The predictable **serial** backend (`num_threads = 1`) is the fair baseline —
it is the WCET reference, and it isolates the kernel from thread-pool scheduling noise (see
[Parallelism and worker threads](../start/features.md#parallelism-and-worker-threads)).

## Tiers

- **L1 — node / end-to-end.** The full ROS node timed by its built-in `exe_time_ms` publisher (present
  identically on both engines), `NDT_USE_RUST` OFF vs ON. **L1a** (automated, `bench/run_l1a.sh`) replays
  the in-repo `standard_sequence` cloud through the node frame-by-frame — deterministic, download-free,
  the CI regression baseline. **L1b** (opt-in, `bench/run_l1b.sh`) replays the Autoware `sample-rosbag`
  against `sample-map-rosbag` for the headline number, downloading the sample data only if absent. That
  bag is raw sensor data (Velodyne packets, ublox GNSS, no PointCloud2, no TF), so `run_l1b.sh` brings
  up the full Autoware sensing + localization graph (`launch/ndt_l1b_bench.launch.xml`: Nebula decode +
  map + EKF/pose-initializer loop); it therefore needs the sensing stack built and a clean DDS state,
  and reproduces the headline on a fresh full-Autoware container. Rely on the deterministic **L1a** for
  regression tracking.
- **L2 — kernel micro-benchmark.** A tight per-frame `align` loop on a small synthetic cloud, to
  locate where time goes and bound per-frame WCET. Crate example `examples/wcet_frame.rs`.
- **L3 — offline differential replay.** One executable drives **both** engines on identical inputs
  (`bench/ndt_bench_replay.cpp`); realistic point density, zero live jitter. This is the tier with
  measured results below.

## What L3 measures

`bench/ndt_bench_replay.cpp` builds the target map **and kd-tree once per engine**, then times only
the repeated `align` loop with `steady_clock` — so it measures the align kernel, not map
construction. Both engines read the **same** synthetic geometry (three orthogonal planes at
`interval` spacing) from the same buffers, so the comparison is apples-to-apples by construction. It
emits per-align latency samples as JSON, which `bench/gen_report.py` renders into a self-contained
HTML report.

Fidelity controls: identical inputs and identical convergence (`iteration_num` must match, else the
engines did different work), a warmup phase, align-loop-only timing, and optional core pinning for a
stable tail (`TASKSET="taskset -c 2"`).

## Running

```sh
# L3 offline replay (both engines) — needs the Rust backend + the opt-in bench target.
colcon build --packages-select autoware_ndt_scan_matcher \
  --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DNDT_USE_RUST=ON -DNDT_BUILD_BENCH=ON
bench/run.sh [ITERS] [WARMUP] [INTERVAL]   # -> bench/ndt_bench.json + bench/report.html
#   env: TASKSET="taskset -c 2" (pin a core), OUT_DIR=/path

# L1a node end-to-end, deterministic synthetic cloud, C++ (OFF) vs Rust (ON). The runner does the
# OFF/ON rebuild two-pass itself (opt-in NDT_BUILD_BENCH_L1); no download.
bench/run_l1a.sh [ITERS] [WARMUP]          # -> bench/l1a.json + bench/l1a_report.html

# L1b node end-to-end on the real Autoware sample-rosbag (opt-in; downloads ~193 MB if absent).
bench/run_l1b.sh                           # -> bench/l1b.json + bench/l1b_report.html
#   env: BAG_LIDAR_TOPIC=<bag lidar topic>, AUTOWARE_DATA_DIR=/path

# L2 per-frame WCET micro-benchmark (crate only, no colcon).
cargo run --release --example wcet_frame
```

### L3 — align-loop latency (as of 2026-07-07)

Synthetic 3-plane cloud, **30,603 points**, `resolution = 2.0`, `max_iterations = 30`,
**`num_threads = 1` (serial)**, 200 iterations after 20 warmup, `steady_clock`. **Both engines
converge in `iteration_num = 4`** (equal work). Latency per `align` call, milliseconds:

| Engine | min | median | mean | p95 | max |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| C++ (`multigrid_ndt_omp`) | 360.61 | 366.64 | 366.44 | 370.68 | 372.33 |
| Rust (`autoware_ndt_scan_matcher_rs`) | 118.19 | 118.67 | 118.71 | 119.06 | 120.50 |

**Rust is ≈ 3.1× faster** at the median (366.64 / 118.67 = 3.09×; ≈ 3.1× at p95 too) on this
workload.

*Environment:* AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX (16 logical cores), governor `powersave`, no CPU pinning,
`rustc 1.96.0`, `g++ 11.4.0`.

### L2 — per-frame WCET (`examples/wcet_frame.rs`)

Rust serial `align`, small 288-point cloud, 5 iterations, 20,000 frames (µs per frame):

| p50 | p99 | p99.9 | max |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 524 | 647 | 859 | 1090 |

(min 513 µs, mean 529 µs.) The bounded, low-spread tail reflects the allocation-free, panic-free
align path (see [The WCET contract](../rt/wcet.md)).

### Caveats

These are a point-in-time snapshot under specific conditions — synthetic plane geometry, the
**serial** backend, **align-loop only** (map construction excluded), and one CPU. The L2 and L3 rows
use different cloud sizes (288 vs 30,603 points), so their absolute times are not comparable. Real
sequences, the parallel backend, or the full node pipeline will shift the ratios; treat the ≈3× as
indicative for this align workload, not a universal figure.
