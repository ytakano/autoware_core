# The NDT engine

`NdtEngine` (`src/engine.rs`) is the persistent handle that wraps the target map + params over a
stable interface. C++ drives incremental map updates, alignment, and scoring through it. The
defining design choices are **`&self`-only methods** and **interior mutability**, chosen so a
shared `&NdtEngine` is sound across concurrent ROS callbacks *without an external mutex*.

## State

The engine holds its mutable state behind interior-mutability cells:

- **`EngineState`** — the target `VoxelGridMap`, the `NdtParams`, the convergence params, the
  covariance config.
- **regularization** — a tiny separate cell, so setting it per frame never clones the map.
- **align scratch** — caller-owned mutable workspace and result storage, not part of engine state (see [MatchScratch](scratch.md)).

The config API is a set of `&self` setters that publish new state: `set_params`,
`set_convergence_params`, `set_covariance_config`, `set_regularization`. Map lifecycle:
`add_target`, `remove_target`, `create_kdtree`, and `commit_from` (the
atomic map-update commit). See [Engine state and the config API](engine-state.md).

## Concurrency: three configurations

The interior-mutability cell is chosen at compile time. This is the crate's central concurrency
decision; the full treatment is in [Concurrency and interior mutability](concurrency.md).

| Build | Cell | Read/align path | Scratch | `Sync` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **std** (default) | `ArcSwap<EngineState>` | `load` an immutable snapshot **lock-free** | caller-owned | yes |
| **`no_std` single-core** | `RefCell<Arc<…>>` | borrow | caller-owned | **no** |
| **`no_std` `mt`** | `awkernel_sync::Mutex<Arc<…>>` | short critical section (refcount bump) | **caller-owned** | yes |

Key properties in the concurrent configs (std, `mt`):

- **No lock is held across an alignment.** The align path loads an `Arc` snapshot and works on
  it; a concurrent map update publishes a *new* state, and the old snapshot lives until its last
  reader drops it.
- **Map updates never mutate in place.** `apply_map_update` builds the new map on a **private
  staging engine**, then `commit_from` swaps it in with a single atomic store — a lock-free
  double-buffer. A concurrent align therefore never observes a partial or kd-tree-less map.
- A compile-time `assert_send_sync::<NdtEngine>()` proves `Sync` in the std/`mt` configs; the
  single-core `no_std` engine is intentionally `!Sync`, so the compiler rejects sharing it.

This replaces the C++ giant `ndt_ptr_` mutex on the hot path.

## What the engine is *not*

The engine is the read/update data structure, not the control loop. The WCET-bounded computation
is the free function [`ndt::align`](align.md); node-level state (pose buffers, activation) lives
in the `NdtScanMatcherRs` shell, not here.
