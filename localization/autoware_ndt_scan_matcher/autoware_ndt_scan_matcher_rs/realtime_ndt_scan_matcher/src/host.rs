//! Portable host-interface ports for the NDT scan-matcher node logic.
//!
//! The orchestration in [`crate::scan_matcher`] is written **generically over `H: Host`** so the same
//! `no_std` Rust runs on any environment, which only differs *below* these ports:
//! - the ROS node implements them via rclcpp (a Rust `FfiHost` adapter over the C-ABI vtables);
//! - a bare-metal / `no_std` async kernel implements them with its own async runtime + map source;
//! - `examples/tokio_ndt.rs` implements them with Tokio + synthetic data (the async reference).
//!
//! The **I/O ports are `async`** (map loading is inherently async — a ROS service future, a kernel DMA
//! read, …) declared with return-position `impl Future` so no boxing/`Send` bound is forced (clean in
//! `no_std`, static dispatch). The engine **align hot path stays synchronous** (WCET) — it is called
//! between awaits, never `async`.
