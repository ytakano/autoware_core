//! Deterministic algorithmic-cost counters for the WCET analysis (`plan/ndt_wcet.md`, Layer 2).
//!
//! The engine's frame time decomposes as
//! `T ≤ N_iter × [Σ_p (T_search(p) + K(p)·T_kernel) + T_solve]`, so these counters capture the only
//! data-dependent cost drivers: derivative passes (≤ iterations + 1), points processed, neighbors
//! collected (K ≤ [`crate::ndt::MAX_NEIGHBORS`] per point per pass), and kd-tree nodes visited.
//! Being platform-independent and reproducible, they are the worst-input **search fitness** (far
//! more stable than wall time) and the machine-checked link to the analytic bound
//! (`tests/wcet_bounds.rs`).
//!
//! Only compiled under the `wcet-count` feature; the shipping hot path carries zero instrumentation
//! cost when the feature is off. The counters cover the **serial** backend (the WCET baseline) —
//! the `parallel` reduction does not accumulate them.

/// Algorithmic-cost counters for one [`crate::ndt::align`] call (reset at the start of each align).
